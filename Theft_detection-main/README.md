Electricity Theft Detection on Smart Meter Data
Smart Meters are seen as an important technological device to prevent electricity theft and help detect and prevent tampering of electrical equipment.In general terms, a smart meter is an electronic device that records electricity consumption at short intervals and communicates it back on a real-time basis to a utility for monitoring and billing.Similarly, using smart meters, utilities can monitor households or commercial establishments that do not pay their bills and can shut down their services remotely.Smart meters will have in-built tamper detection facilities which will send a real-time notification when there is an attempt to tamper.
